# Performance_MPI_Applications
This repository contains some review material about several monitoring tools for MPI applications.
This material was presented twice in a teaching and Research invitation at Polytechnic School of University of Lleida, 
Spain, May 6-10 of 2013 and May 13-14 of 2014.

The material consists in:
- A short presentation about how to measure the  MPI applications' performance, 
and which tools can be used to improve it [Tutorial1](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/Performance_MPI_Applications/blob/master/Parallel_Performance_Analysis_Tutorial1.pdf)
- A presentation about Jumpshot, Vampir and Taul features [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/Performance_MPI_Applications/blob/master/Jumpshot_Vampir_TAU_Tutorial2.pdf)
- Three [Performance exercises](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/Performance_MPI_Applications/blob/master/Performance_exercises.pdf) to improve the performance of mpi applications by using Jumpshot and TAU.
The required [material](https://github.com/rosafilgueira/Performance_MPI_Applications/tree/master/mpi_exercise) to execute those exercises is also provided (except the tools).


Jumpshot can be downloaded [here](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/perfvis/software/viewers/)
